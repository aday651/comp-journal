Things to look at:
- Look at Lake Laneer, and determine the size of the lake over time (variations etc)
- Look at each of the counties surrounding Atlanta (along with Fulton county itself), understand

- Get the split maps working locally 
- Understand what is happening near the highways - take a look at what is happening with landsat
