### TODO list

- Rivers: look for rivers with history of water problems over a month, see
if there is anything interesting, also try extracting values and looking
at this (for variance and overall trends)
- Macon county - peaches over time
- For cropland in Georgia: look at the top five states and their produce, see
if anything interesting is arising - e.g with blueberry farms transitioning
to other types of farms/crops, more farms popping up, tobacco farms transitioning
to different types:
    - Interesting question: how has farmland been changing? (if at all)
    - Pull pixel values for the crops I'm interested in, by county, and see
    what I get.
- Look at Cherokee county (satellite images) over time, see if there is any
build-up.
- Build up in the Atlanta area over time
- Vegetation health of the Okefenokee Swamp over the time since the fires
